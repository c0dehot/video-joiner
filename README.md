## Video Joiner Tool #

A bash script to allow you to join multiple video files, choosing to trim the start/finish of each. If they are all mp4, it does not transcode them, so is quite fast.

Here's what the output is like:

And here's a quick YouTube tutorial on using it:

You can grab the actual script file directly here:

This tool is built around *ffmpeg*(https://ffmpeg.org/). Thanks to open source and the awesome tools out there!
